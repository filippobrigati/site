This is my portfolio and personal website, sometimes I also write some articles.

## About me

I'm a 23-year-old software developer, [working professionally](https://www.linkedin.com/in/filippo-brigati/) since December 2021 
while pursuing a degree in [Computer Science](https://corsi.unibo.it/laurea/InformaticaManagement) at University of Bologna.

Lately, I’ve been diving into C to get better at low-level stuff, 
and I’m also getting into iOS app development with Swift and SwiftUI.

When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me hiking in the mountains, cycling around, or playing beach volleyball.
